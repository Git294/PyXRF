# The file was automatically generated.
#
# Instructions for editing this file:
#
# Description of each standard starts with '- name: ...'. Every following line
#   must be indented by 4 spaces. Each description contains the following items:
#   'name' (name of the standard, arbitrary string), 'serial' (serial number, of
#   the standard, but can be arbitrary string, 'description' (string that contains
#   description of the standard). Those fields may be filled with arbitrary information,
#   best suited to distinguish the standard later. If string consists of only digits
#   (in case of serial number) it must be enclosed in quotes.
#
# The field 'compounds' lists all compounds in the standard. The compounds are
#   presented in the form <compound_formula>: <concentration>.
#   <compound_formula> has to be a valid chemical formula, representing a pure
#   element (C, Fe, Ga, etc.) or compound (Fe2O3, GaAs, etc). Element names
#   must start with a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter (if present).
#   No characters except 'A-Z', 'a-z' and '0-1' are allowed. Lines containing
#   compound specifications must be indented by extra 4 spaces.
#
# The optional field 'density' specifies total density of the sample and used
#   to check integrity of the data (the sum of densities of all compounds
#   must be equaly to 'density' value.
#
# All density values (for compounds and total density) are specified in ug/cm^2
#
# Example (the lines contain extra '#' character, which is not part of YAML file):
#
#-   name: Micromatter 41164
#    serial: '41164'
#    description: CeF3 21.1 / Au 20.6
#    compounds:
#        CeF3: 21.1
#        Au: 20.6
#    density: 41.7
#
# The easiest way to start creating the list of custom standards is to uncomment
#   and edit the following example. To create extra records, duplicate and
#   edit the example or any existing record.

#-    name: Name of the Standard
#     serial: '32654'
#     description: CeF3 21.1 / Au 20.6 (any convenient description)
#     compounds:
#         CeF3: 21.1
#         Au: 20.6

    Save descriptions of of XRF standards to YAML file

    Parameters
    ----------

    file_path: str
        absolute or relative path to the saved YAML file. If the path does not exist, then
        it is created.

    standard_data: list(dict)
        list of dictionaries, each dictionary is representing the description of one
        XRF standard. Sending ``[]`` will create YAML file, which contains only instructions
        for manual editing of records. Such file can be read by the function
        ``load_xrf_standard_yaml_file``, which returns ``[]``.

    overwrite_existing: bool
        indicates if existing file should be overwritten. Default is False, since
        overwriting of an existing parameter file will lead to loss of data.

    Returns
    -------

        no value is returned

    Raises
    ------

    IOError if the YAML file already exists and ``overwrite_existing`` is not enabled.
