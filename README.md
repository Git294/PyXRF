#PyXRF

PyXRF is a python-based sophisticated fluorescence analysis package for
fitting and visualizing X-ray fluorescence data. This package contains a
high-level fitting engine, comprehensive command-line/GUI design, rigorous
physics calculation and a powerful visualization interface. The theoretical
part of PyXRF is based on MAPS, developed by Stefan Vogt at APS. PyXRF offers
some of the unique features as follows.
- Automatic elements finding: Users do not need to spend extra time selecting
  elements manually.
- Forward calculation: Users can observe the spectrum from forward calculation
  at real time while adjusting input parameters. This will help users perform
  sensitivity analysis, and find an appropriate initial guess for fitting.
- Construct your own fitting algorithm: An advanced mode was created for
  advanced users to construct their own fitting strategies with a full
  control of each fitting parameter.
- Batch mode: Users can easily perform quick fitting of multiple fluorescence
  datasets or XANES datasets.
- Interface with NSLS-II database: A specific I/O interface was designed to
   obtain data directly from BNL/NSLS-II experimental database.


## Documentation

### h5 file for PyXRF
Please download a standard h5 file from the following link
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B45Mm22EF9TNQzFkSW0xa01mbkE/view .
This standard h5 file mainly contains spectrum from 3 detectors, positions of x,y motors and scalers for normalization. Please create h5 file with similar structure in order to use PyXRF.

For test purposes, a parameter file (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B45Mm22EF9TNYW11OXozRXVic1E/view) is also provided for users to do fitting for this standard h5 file. However, you should never create parameter file manually. Parameter file can easily created during the step of automatic peak finding.

## Installation from Conda
Currently PyXRF only works for python 2.7. `pyxrf` is not compatible with
python 3+ because it relies on the [enaml] (http://github.com/nucleic/enaml) library, which is not python 3 compatible as of this writing (11/2015).

### Linux/Mac (El Captain is working!)
First you need to install [conda] (http://continuum.io/downloads). We suggest
anaconda because it is a complete installation of the entire scientific python
stack, but is ~400 MB.  For advanced users, consider downloading [miniconda]
(http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) because it is a smaller download (~20 MB).

Then create a conda environment(say pyxrf_test) with python2.7.
```
$ conda create -n pyxrf_test python=2.7
```
Then go to the environment named pyxrf_test
```
$ source activate pyxrf_test
```
At the same environment, install pyxrf by simply typing
```
$ conda install -c licode pyxrf
```

### Run
```
$ pyxrf
```

#### Update
```
$ conda update -c licode pyxrf
```

#### Reminder
Every time you open a new terminal, make sure to go to pyxrf_test environment first, then launch the software.
```
$ source activate pyxrf_test
$ pyxrf
```
To leave this environment, just type
```
$ source deactivate
```


### Windows
The blocking issue for getting `pyxrf` running on windows is creating a conda
package for [xraylib] (https://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib).  If enough users
request this feature, we will make it happen.  Until then it is on the back
burner.  


## Notes

The core fitting functions are a part of the [scikit-xray]
(https://github.com/scikit-beam/scikit-beam) data analysis library for xray data analysis.
The design philosophy is to separate fitting and gui, so it is easy to maintain.
