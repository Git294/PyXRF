## Installation from Conda

### Linux/Mac
Currently PyXRF only works for python2.0+, not python3.0.
First you need to install [Conda] (http://continuum.io/downloads), then create a conda environment(say pyxrf_test) with python2.7.

```
$conda create -n pyxrf_test python=2.7
```
Then go to the environment named pyxrf_test
```
$source activate pyxrf_test
```
At the same environment, install pyxrf by simply typing
```
$conda install -c licode pyxrf
```
Launch the software.
```
$pyxrf
```


Reminder:
Every time you open a new terminal, make sure to go to pyxrf_test environment first, then launch the software.
```
$source activate pyxrf_test
$pyxrf
```
To leave this environment, just type
```
source deactivate
```



### Windows
Under development.


## Notes

The core fitting functions are written at scikit-xray https://github.com/scikit-xray/scikit-xray.
The design philosophy is to separate fitting and gui, so it is easy to maintain.
